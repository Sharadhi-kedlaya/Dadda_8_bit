# Dadda_8_bit
Dadda 8-bit High-Speed Low-Power Multiplier This project implements an 8-bit Dadda multiplier architecture optimized for high-speed and low-power operation. The Dadda algorithm is an efficient parallel multiplier design that minimizes the number of partial product reduction stages, resulting in faster computation with reduced hardware complexity.
